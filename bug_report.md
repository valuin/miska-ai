# Bug Report: `documentPreview` not being passed to server

## Summary

The `documentPreview` object is not being passed from the client to the server when using the Vercel AI SDK's `useChat` hook. This is despite the fact that the client-side logs show the `documentPreview` being correctly added to the `handleSubmit` function's `body` parameter.

## What I've Tried

1.  **Initial Diagnosis**: I initially believed the problem was in the server-side code (`app/(chat)/api/chat/handlePost.ts`), and that it was not correctly parsing the `documentPreview` from the request body. I attempted to fix this by modifying the server-side code to look for the `documentPreview` in different places in the request body. This did not work.
2.  **Second Diagnosis**: I then believed the problem was a race condition in the client-side code (`components/multimodal-input.tsx`), where the `documentPreview` was being deleted before it could be read. I attempted to fix this by reordering the operations in the `submitForm` function. This did not work.
3.  **Third Diagnosis**: I then believed the problem was in the way the `useChat` hook's `experimental_prepareRequestBody` function was being used. I attempted to fix this by modifying the function to correctly handle the `body` passed from `handleSubmit`. This did not work.
4.  **Fourth Diagnosis**: My final attempt was to use the `data` field in the `handleSubmit` options, as this is the recommended way to send extra data with the Vercel AI SDK. This also did not work.

## Conclusion

I have exhausted all possible solutions that I can think of. I believe the problem is either a bug in the Vercel AI SDK, or there is a fundamental concept that I am missing. I am therefore passing this task on to a more qualified individual.
